Tasks\n\nYou do not need to submit anything for these tasks, but are expected to have completed and know the material.\n\n### Task 1. Beginning steps to configure Git/GitHub: Part 2\n\na. Configure git and store your personal access token.  \n\n- [Instructions for MacOS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/meds-install-mac.html#configure-git)\n- [Instructions for Windows](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/meds-install-windows.html#configure-git)\n    \n:::{.callout-note}\nNote: make sure git is installed. You did this last week for one of your homework tasks, but if it wasn’t installed and you didn’t install it, do it now!\n:::\n\n### Task 2. Read Lowndes and Horst 2020, [“Tidy data for efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration.”](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/)\n\n### Task 3. Read Horst and Lowndes 2022, [“GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing, and failing safely.”](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2022/05/27/github-illustrated-series/)\n\n### Task 4. Install R packages\n\n#### `lterdatasampler`\n\nRead about the package [here](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/index.html).  \n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThis is a package that is not hosted on CRAN, so you will need to install it in a different way than we installed `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins`.  Find the Installation section on the package website for details.  \n:::\n    \n#### `janitor`\n\nRead about the package [here](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor).\n\n## Part 2. Problems\n\n### Problem 1. Raptor abundance between restoration plots (10 points)\n\nManagers at Coal Oil Point Reserve (COPR) are interested in the relationship between restored areas and raptor abundance: as different parts of the reserve are restored to native grassland, small mammal (i.e. mice, gopher, vole) abundances should increase, which should attract more raptors (i.e. hawks, falcons) to the reserve. You conduct weekly surveys for raptors at COPR from April to June in one of the restoration areas  and collect the following data on the number of raptors you see for each survey:\n\n$$\n0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 0\n$$\n\na. What kind of data did you collect, and why? Explain in 1-2 sentences. **(2 points)**  \nb. What is a better description of the variability in raptor count, standard deviation or standard error? Explain why in 1-2 sentences and calculate the metric of your choice, showing your work. **(4 points)**  \nc. What is a better description of the uncertainty in raptor count, standard deviation or standard error? Explain why in 1-2 sentences and calculate the metric of your choice, showing your work. **(4 points)**  \n\n### Problem 2. Sugar maple stem masses (38 points)\n\nUsing the `hbr_maples` data set from `lterdatasampler`, answer the question: **Does mean sugar maple stem mass in 2003 differ between reference and calcium-treated watersheds?**  \n\nFor any calculations for which you need a confidence level, use 95% with the corresponding significance level.  \n\na. In one sentence each, write your null and alternative hypotheses to address this question. **(2 points)**   \nb. Make a QQ plot. In one sentence, describe whether the variable is normally distributed or not. **(4 points)**     \nc. Check variances. In one sentence, describe whether the groups have equal variances or not. **(4 points)**   \nd. Calculate the critical value for your test. **(4 points)**   \ne. Do a t-test. **(4 points)**   \n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n# Hint\nDouble check your arguments to make sure you’re running the right test.\n:::\n\nf. Calculate an effect size and show the output. **(4 points)**  \ng. Make a figure with mean and confidence intervals showing the raw data underneath the summary information. Make sure that your plot is [finalized](https://spring-2024.envs-193ds.com/resources/finalizing-plots). For full credit on your plot, adjust the `ggplot()`/`geom_()` defaults such that your plot has:  \n\n    i. Different colors for each watershed  \n    ii. Different shapes for each watershed  \n    iii. A different font than the default   \n    iv. No gridlines  \n    **(6 points)**\n    \nh. Write a “methods” section. In one sentence each, describe:  \n\n    i. Why the test you chose may have been appropriate for testing your hypotheses in part a   \n    ii. How you evaluated normality and homogeneity of variance  \n    **(4 points)**\n    \ni. Write a “results” section. Describe the results in your own words, making sure to include the:  \n\n    i. Test you ran   \n    ii. Number of observations for each watershed\n    iii. Significance level\n    iv. Degrees of freedom\n    v. Test statistic\n    vi. p-value\n    vii. Confidence interval in the difference in mean stem masses between watershed\n    viii. Effect size  \n    **(6 points)**\n\n### Problem 3. Statistical critique (10 points)\nCheck the [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGh39-AZ0RoEuY3VqjUQ_JORli-2wQ_O6EPRl20iy6k/edit?usp=sharing) and choose a paper to use for your critique based on An’s/Caitlin’s recommendations. Answer the following questions about the paper in 1-2 sentences each:  \n\na. Why were you interested in this paper? **(2 points)**  \nb. What questions/hypotheses are the authors addressing? **(2 points)**  \nc. What statistical tests are the authors doing? **(2 points)**  \nd. Find the figure in the paper that is associated with the statistical tests from question (c). What are the x- and y-axes, and what does the figure show (i.e. what is the main message of the figure)? **(2 points)**  \ne. Insert the figure into your homework document. **(2 points)**\n\n## Checklist\n\nYour homework should \n\n- Include your name, the title (“Homework 2”), and the date you turned in the assignment **(3 points)**  \n- Include for Problem 1:\n    - responses for a-c \n    - full work (hand written or R code) for parts b-c\n- Include for Problem 2:\n    - written response for part a  \n    - full work (R code), output, and written response for parts b-c  \n    - full work (R code) and output for parts d-f  \n    - full work (R code) and output for part g  \n    - written response for parts h-i  \n- Include for Problem 3:\n    - written responses for parts a-e\n- be uploaded to Canvas as a single PDF **(1 point)**  \n- be organized and readable **(5 points)**\n\n**67 points total**\n\n\n\n\n",
