If you feel compelled to do so, post it on the discussion forum on Canvas so that everyone can marvel at your ugly plot!  \n\n# Starting out\n\nThis is a figure using the Trash Wheel data set from Workshop 4. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read in packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# read in data\ntrashwheel <- read_csv(here::here(\"workshop\", \"data\", \"trashwheel.csv\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nI'm going to start with a basic plot with date on the x-axis and weight on the y-axis. I'll also create lines and points representing the trash collected by each trash wheel.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrash_plot <- ggplot(data = trashwheel,      # use the trash wheel data frame\n                     aes(x = date,           # put date on the x-axis\n                         y = weight,         # put weight on the y-axis\n                         color = name)) +    # color everything by the name of the trash wheel\n  geom_point() +                             # make a layer of points\n  geom_line() +                              # make a layer of lines\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +        # put the legend on the bottom\n  facet_wrap(~ name)                         # separate the trash wheels into different columns\n\ntrash_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](optional-problem-03_files/figure-html/starter-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom this visualization, it seems that the original Mister Trash Wheel collects more trash in weight than the other trash wheels. What are the units of weight? Who knows!\n\n# Making things worse\n\nYou can play around with the `theme()` arguments to really make your ugly plot shine. If you add each argument one by one (for example, I added `axis.title.x`, looked at the output, then added `axis.title.y` and so forth), you can start to understand which argument goes with what part of the plot. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrash_plot +\n  theme(\n    \n    # axis adjustments\n    axis.title.x = element_text(angle = 180, family = \"Papyrus\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 60, family = \"Times New Roman\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 120, family = \"Garamond\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(color = \"lightblue\", angle = 180, family = \"Bradley Hand\"),\n    axis.ticks.y = element_line(color = \"red\"),\n    axis.ticks.x.bottom = element_line(color = \"limegreen\"),\n    axis.line.y = element_line(color = \"purple\"),\n    \n    # legend adjustments\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"blue\"),\n    legend.direction = \"vertical\",\n    legend.title = element_text(color = \"white\", family = \"American Typewriter\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(color = \"pink\", family = \"Curlz MT\"),\n    \n    # panel adjustments\n    panel.background = element_rect(color = \"orange\", fill = \"darkred\"),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(linetype = 3),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(linetype = 6, color = \"purple4\"),\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(linetype = 5, color = \"orchid\"),\n    \n    # plot (as in, everything that's not the panel)\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#289793\"),\n    \n    # strips for the facet\n    strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#809283\"),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, family = \"Imprint MT Shadow\")\n    \n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](optional-problem-03_files/figure-html/uglier-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTake the plot you made in workshop and make it ugly.
