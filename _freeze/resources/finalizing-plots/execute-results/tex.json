This is _especially_ relevant to environmental science: you're responsible for communicating not just about the environment, but what evidence (i.e. data) supports your claim. Therefore, it is crucial that environmental scientists communicate about their data clearly and effectively.  \n\nIn this class, your plots will be assessed using three (very broad) criteria:  \n1. **accuracy**: is your plot accurately and _truthfully_ representing the data?  \n2. **clarity**: is your plot clearly representing a pattern, relationship, message?  \n3. **aesthetics**: does your plot look good?  \n\n# General rules for good-looking plots\n\n_(adapted from Allison Horst)_\n\n## Non-negotiable (if you are missing these, you will not get full credit for your plot)\n\n- Axes must have **complete** labels with units (very few exceptions to this)\n    - for example: body_mass_g should be \"Body mass (g)\"\n- If plotting regression or correlation lines, underlying data must be displayed on plot in addition to predicted lines\n- Concise, descriptive title (if presented alone and not in a report)\n\n## Additional points  \n\n- logical start and end values of x or y axes (these are usually by default in `ggplot`, but you should double check)\n- if gridlines aren't useful to understand the data, remove them\n- figure background should be white (easier to see points)\n- text labels should be large enough to see/read clearly\n- use color sparingly and be aware of color-blind friendly palettes\n- use one font throughout a plot\n- figure fonts should match text font (for example, don't use Arial in a figure when the rest of your text is in Times New Roman)\n- make sure your plot size and aspect ratio renders correctly  \n\nIn general, **the simpler you can make a plot, the better.**\n\n# Bad/better examples\n\nSome examples of bad and better plots follow using the `{palmerpenguins}` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins %>% \n  group_by(island, species) %>% \n  count() %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"penguins\") +\n  facet_wrap(~island)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finalizing-plots_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhy is this bad?  \n- gap between bottom of bars and x-axis  \n- meaningless y axis  \n- gray background against gray bars and black text is hard to see  \n- gridlines don't do much\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins %>% \n  group_by(island, species) %>% \n  count() %>% \n  # fill argument colors the bars by species\n  ggplot(aes(x = island, y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"darkgrey\", color = \"#000000\") +\n  # the argument expand takes away the gap at the bottom and at the top of the plot\n  # limits sets the limits of the axis\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 130)) +\n  labs(title = \"Penguin counts differ across species and islands\",\n       x = \"Island\", \n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n        panel.grid = element_blank(),\n        strip.background = element_blank(),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 14),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\") +\n  facet_wrap(~species)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finalizing-plots_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n",
