## 1. Description

In this optional problem, you'll try a one-sample t-test in code. In lecture, we talked about the different values you'll want to keep in mind: the t~statistic~, the p-value, the t~critical~, and the significance level (or $\alpha$).

## 2. Creosote heights

![](/assignments/images/optional-problem-02/Picture1.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}


You overhear a conversation where someone makes a claim that creosote (_Larrea tridentata_) shrubs are 3 m tall. 
On your next walk through the desert, you decide to measure some shrubs (n = 40). From these 40 shrubs, you calculate the following summary statistics:

$$
\begin{align}
\bar{y} &= 1.8 m \\
s &= 0.26 m
\end{align}
$$

**Using your sample, you ask: how does my sample compare to the claim that I heard?**  

For this problem, use a 95% confidence level with the corresponding significance level for a two tailed test.

## 3. Steps

0. Draw a t-distribution and label the **t~critical~** and the significance level.  
1. Create a script or Quarto document to work in.  
2. Copy/paste the code in the Set up code chunk into your script. Run the code.  
3. Write your hypotheses in biological and statistical terms.  
4. Calculate the **t~statistic~** using the test statistic formula for a one sample t-test.    
5. Calculate the **t~critical~** using `qt()`.
6. Calculate the **p-value** for your test statistic using `pt()`.  
7. Draw the **t~statistic~** and **p-value** on your distribution from step 0. Take a moment to think: do you have evidence to suggest that creosote shrubs _are not_ 3 m tall?  
8. Use `t.test()` to verify that your calculations from steps 3-5 are correct.  
9. In one sentence, summarize your findings.  

### Set up code 

```{r problem-setup}
#| eval: false

# read in the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# data
creosote <- c(1.61, 1.86, 1.55, 2.28, 1.90, 
              1.55, 1.95, 2.02, 1.97, 1.71,
              2.25, 1.92, 1.61, 1.14, 2.14, 
              1.79, 1.80, 2.08, 2.05, 1.98, 
              2.08, 2.03, 1.82, 1.20, 1.99,
              1.78, 1.75, 1.36, 1.66, 1.93,
              2.21, 1.77, 1.92, 1.78, 1.39,
              1.68, 1.68, 1.78, 2.13, 2.03)
```

## 3. Solution

### 0. draw a t-distribution and label

You should do this by hand, but this is just here for reference.

```{r t-dist-and-label}
# calculating t-critical (need this for the plot)
t_critical <- qt(p = 0.05/2, df = 40 - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)

# plotting the distribution
tdist_plot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = -5:5), aes(x)) +
  
  # first plotting the shaded areas under the curve (significance level)
  # this is the area to the right
  stat_function(geom = "area", 
                fun = dt, 
                args = list(df = 1), 
                xlim = c(t_critical, 30), 
                fill = "darkgrey") +
  # this is the area to the left
  stat_function(geom = "area", 
                fun = dt, 
                args = list(df = 1), 
                xlim = c(-30, -t_critical), 
                fill = "darkgrey") +
  
  # then, plotting the boundaries at the critical t value: 2.022
  # this is the line on the right
  annotate(geom = "linerange", 
           x = t_critical, 
           ymin = 0, 
           ymax = 0.065, 
           linewidth = 1, 
           lty = 2, 
           color = "#000000") +
  # this is the line on the left
  annotate(geom = "linerange", 
           x = -t_critical, 
           ymin = 0, 
           ymax = 0.065, 
           linewidth = 1, 
           lty = 2, 
           color = "#000000") +
  
  # lastly, plot the t-distribution
  stat_function(geom = "line", 
                n = 1000, 
                fun = dt, 
                args = list(df = 1), 
                linewidth = 1, 
                color = "#000000") +
  
  # controlling plot aesthetics
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), 
                     limits = c(0, 0.32)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.margin = unit(c(1, 0, 0, 0), "cm"))

tdist_plot
```

In this plot, the **dashed line** is the **t~critical~**, and the **shaded areas** are the **significance level**. They are split between the two tails because this is a two tailed test (not directional). 

### 3. Write your hypotheses in biological and statistical terms.

#### Biological

Creosote shrub height is different from the claim.

#### Statistical

H~0~: Mean creosote shrub height is 3 m.  
H~A~: Mean creosote shrub height _is not_ 3 m.

### 4. Calculate the t-statistic.

```{r creosote-t-score}
# claimed mean
mu <- 3

# number of observations
n <- length(creosote)

# sample mean
ybar <- mean(creosote)

# sample standard deviation
s <- sd(creosote)

# sample standard error
se <- s/sqrt(n)

# t-score
t <- (ybar-mu)/se

t
```

### 5. Calculate t~critical~

```{r t-crit}
t_critical <- qt(p = 0.05/2, df = n - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)

t_critical
```

### 6. Calculate the p-value

```{r p-val}
2*pt(q = t, df = n - 1, lower = TRUE)
```

### 7. Draw the t~statistic~ and p-value

```{r redraw-dist}
#| message: false

tdist_plot +

  # this is the line on the right
  annotate(geom = "linerange", 
           x = t, 
           ymin = 0, 
           ymax = 0.3, 
           linewidth = 1, 
           color = "#239a89") +
  # this is the line on the left
  annotate(geom = "linerange", 
           x = -t, 
           ymin = 0, 
           ymax = 0.3, 
           linewidth = 1, 
           color = "#239a89") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-30, 30))
```

In this plot, the teal lines represent the t~statistic~. They are *way way way* past the t~critical~. I'm not plotting the p-value here, because I know for sure that the threshold has been met for me to think, "It's so unlikely that these creosote shrubs come from a population with a mean height of 3 m that I actually think they came from a population with a different mean height."

### 8. Use `t.test()`

```{r creosote-t-test}
t.test(creosote, mu = 3)
```

### 9. Report your findings

We tested the hypothesis that creosote height was different from the claim of 3 m. We measured the height of 40 creosote shrubs and found a significant difference between our sample and the claim (two-tailed one sample t-test, t(39) = -27.8, p < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05).

:::{.callout-note title="Reporting your findings"}
For most tests, the information in the parentheses would be:  

(test, distribution(degrees of freedom) = test statistic, p-value, $\alpha$).  

This changes slightly based on the test, but this is the general form.
