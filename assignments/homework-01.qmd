Subject to change before in-class assignment on Monday the 7th of April
:::

[Due on Wednesday April 16 (Week 3) at 11:59 PM]{style="color: #79ACBD; font-size: 24px;"}

Read these instructions before starting your homework and follow them carefully. See the end of this assignment for a checklist of components that your assignment must have at minimum (i.e. to earn at least partial credit). Only submit the items in that list, in the order requested.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I'm having trouble rendering to PDF. What can I do?

You could either install all the additional things R is asking for you to install, or you can render to a word doc instead (change `pdf` in the top part of the document to `docx`) and save that doc as a PDF. 

### I don't know how to insert an image into a Quarto document. How do I do that?

Here is a [resource for Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html). If you rendered your Quarto file to a word document, you can insert an image into that word document the same way you would with any other word doc.

### Where is the feedback for problem 4?

It is in the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19lnWhFNnCa4Ovxz8SSq8IodSYI7U-CtRwCMa-mx7gus/edit?usp=sharing).

#### You are now ready to start your homework!

## Part 2. Problems, code, and figures

### Problem 1. Measures of central tendency and data spread (12 points)

After this winter's rains, you've developed a new interest in slender salamanders (_Batrachoseps_ spp.) You’ve collected the following lengths (in centimeters) for salamanders:  

$$
4.6, 4.4, 6.2, 5.2, 3.7, 6.0, 3.9, 4.6, 2.7
$$

  a. In one sentence, categorize this data set: what type of data did you collect, and why is it that type? **(2 points)**  
  b. Calculate the sample mean. Express your answer with the correct units and round to 1 decimal point. **(3 points)**  
  c. Calculate the sample variance. Express your answer with the correct units and round to 1 decimal point. **(3 points)**  
  d. Calculate the sample standard deviation. Express your answer with the correct units and round to 1 decimal point. **(3 points)**  

### Problem 2. Visualizing data (22 points)

In this problem, you’ll work with data collected by the National Snow and Ice Data Center on glacial mass and sea level rise. 

Getting set up:  

a. Read the overview information about the data set from the database **(INSERT LINK HERE)**  
b. Read the metadata (data/information about the data) in data file 2 (`glacial_volume_loss.csv`) to understand what each column means.  

Coding:  

f. Load the `tidyverse` package.  
g. Read in data file 1 using `read_csv(“glacial_volume_loss_copy.csv”)` and store that as an object named `glaciers`.  

:::{.callout-tip title="Before you start parts h and i" collapse="true"}
On paper, sketch out the axes for the histogram and the scatterplot. Label the axes, and write down the columns in the data frame you will need to use to make the figures. Draw the bars of the histogram and the points of the scatterplot.  

By doing this before you code up your figure, you'll be able to gain some intuition for what your figure should look like. You can then check your work against what you thought based on your drawing.
:::
b. Open up the two data files and look at them side-by-side. In one sentence, explain how the data files are different. **(2 points)**  
h. Create a histogram of annual sea level rise. Label the x- and y-axes. **(10 points)**  
i. Create a scatterplot of cumulative sea level rise through time (year on the x-axis, cumulative sea level rise on the y-axis). Label the x- and y-axes. **(10 points)**  

### Problem 3. Personal data (20 points total)

This quarter, you'll collect data from your own life to see how data science concepts are part of your daily existence. For this homework assignment, you'll come up with **two ideas for data collection**. The data you collect:

- has to be something you can get at least 30 observations on by week 10 (e.g. minutes to get from ENVS 193DS to your next class, not number of shark views per week)  
- can't something you can get from data collection objects (e.g. number of steps in a day)  
- has to be something that you could actually remember to write down (e.g. liters of water consumed in a day, not time spent on tiktok)  
- has to be be shaped by a question (e.g. how much water do i drink in a day?)  
- has to include variables that would be *appropriate* to share with the class  

For each idea you have (remember you have to come up with two ideas), you should:  

a. articulate a question **(2 points each)**  
b. describe when you would write that data down **(2 points each)**  
c. describe what other variables you think you should measure **(2 points each)**    
d. describe what type of data your variables are **(2 points each)**  
e. design a data sheet with some example data: what are the columns and what are the rows? **(2 points each)**  

**Example:**  

a. Question: How many different types of vegetables do I eat?  
b. I would take data after every meal.  
c. Date, time of day, type of vegetable, meal, whether or not it's cooked, if it's eaten with other things   
d.  

- Date: continuous  
- time of day: categorical (morning, afternoon, evening)  
- meal: categorical (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)  
- cooked: binary (yes/no)  
- eaten with other things: binary (yes/no)  

e.

:::{.callout-note}
#### When can you start collecting data?
An will give you feedback and recommendations for what to pursue for this project on Canvas on Thursday the 17th of April. That means that **you should be able to start collecting data by the end of week 3**, if not sooner.

### Problem 4. Setting up statistical critique (6 points)
Throughout the quarter, you’ll engage in a critique of statistical methods for a published paper. Some methods are appropriate for the data and research questions, and some are not. You’ll be the judge.  

For this homework assignment, you will find 3 candidate papers for your critique. Find 3 papers that speak to your interests - the paper could be on human health, plant restoration, agroecology, or more. Anything you might be interested in within the realm of environmental studies is fair game. Not all 3 papers have to be on the same topic.  

a. For each paper, read the Abstract to get a general sense of what the paper is about. Then, read the Methods section, looking for information on statistical analysis. A paper is a good choice if it includes one of these terms (or something similar) in the analysis description:  

    - t-test  
    - Analysis of variance (ANOVA)  
    - Mann-Whitney U  
    - Kruskal-Wallis  
    - Wilcoxon rank sum  
    - Linear model or linear regression  
    - Spearman correlation  
    - Pearson correlation  
    - logistic regression  
    - Generalized linear mixed effect model  
    
b. Once you’ve verified that your paper includes at least one of the above listed terms, find the [digital object identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/), which is a unique identifier in the form of a URL for a paper. You will know it is a DOI if it has **doi.org** somewhere in the URL.  
c. Once you find the DOI for your paper, add it to the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHmqPOtdEDZ3l6oxgyFrwSDQyQl_uXO0ISt4VF2D3hOq0emQ/viewform?usp=preview). Repeat this for all three papers. **(3 points)**

:::

d. In your homework document, list the papers in alphabetical order by author last name. **(3 points)**  
Your citations should take the form:  
Last name, first name, et al. Year. “Paper title.” _Journal title_ volume:issue.  
Example:  
Sanford, E., et al. 2019. “Widespread shifts in the coastal biota of northern California during the 2014–2016 marine heatwaves.” _Scientific Reports_ 9:4216.
