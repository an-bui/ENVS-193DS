Remember to read the instructions carefully and double check that you have everything on the checklist!

## Part 1. Tasks

You do not need to submit anything for these tasks, but are expected to have completed and know the material.

### Task 1. Beginning steps to configure Git/GitHub: Part 2

a. Configure git and store your personal access token.  

- [Instructions for MacOS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/meds-install-mac.html#configure-git)
- [Instructions for Windows](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/meds-install-windows.html#configure-git)
    
:::{.callout-note}
Note: make sure git is installed. You did this last week for one of your homework tasks, but if it wasn’t installed and you didn’t install it, do it now!
:::

### Task 2. Read Lowndes and Horst 2020, [“Tidy data for efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration.”](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/)

### Task 3. Read Horst and Lowndes 2022, [“GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing, and failing safely.”](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2022/05/27/github-illustrated-series/)

### Task 4. Install R packages

#### `lterdatasampler`

Read about the package [here](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/index.html).  

## Part 2. Problems

**Remember to set up a directory specifically for this homework assignment!**

### Problem 1. Raptor abundance between restoration plots (10 points)

Managers at Coal Oil Point Reserve (COPR) are interested in the relationship between restored areas and raptor abundance: as different parts of the reserve are restored to native grassland, small mammal (i.e. mice, gopher, vole) abundances should increase, which should attract more raptors (i.e. hawks, falcons) to the reserve. You conduct weekly surveys for raptors at COPR from April to June in one of the restoration areas  and collect the following data on the number of raptors you see for each survey:

$$
0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 0
$$

a. What kind of data did you collect, and why? Explain in 1-2 sentences. **(2 points)**  
b. What is a better description of the variability in raptor count, standard deviation or standard error? Explain why in 1-2 sentences and calculate the metric of your choice, showing your work. **(4 points)**  
c. What is a better description of the uncertainty in raptor count, standard deviation or standard error? Explain why in 1-2 sentences and calculate the metric of your choice, showing your work. **(4 points)**  

### Problem 2. Sugar maple stem masses (38 points)

Using the `hbr_maples` data set from `lterdatasampler`, answer the question: **Does mean sugar maple stem mass in 2003 differ between reference and calcium-treated watersheds?**  

For any calculations for which you need a confidence level, use 95% with the corresponding significance level.  

a. In one sentence each, write your null and alternative hypotheses to address this question. **(2 points)**   
b. Make a QQ plot. In one sentence, describe whether the variable is normally distributed or not. **(4 points)**     
c. Check variances. In one sentence, describe whether the groups have equal variances or not. **(4 points)**   
d. Calculate the critical value for your test. **(4 points)**   
e. Do a t-test. **(4 points)**   

:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}
# Hint
Double check your arguments to make sure you’re running the right test.
:::

f. Calculate an effect size and show the output. **(4 points)**  
g. Make a figure with mean and confidence intervals showing the raw data underneath the summary information. Make sure that your plot is [finalized](https://spring-2024.envs-193ds.com/resources/finalizing-plots). For full credit on your plot, adjust the `ggplot()`/`geom_()` defaults such that your plot has:  

    i. Different colors for each watershed  
    ii. Different shapes for each watershed  
    iii. A different font than the default   
    iv. No gridlines  
    **(6 points)**
    
h. Write a “methods” section. In one sentence each, describe:  

    i. Why the test you chose may have been appropriate for testing your hypotheses in part a   
    ii. How you evaluated normality and homogeneity of variance  
    **(4 points)**
    
i. Write a “results” section. Describe the results in your own words, making sure to include the:  

    i. Test you ran   
    ii. Number of observations for each watershed
    iii. Significance level
    iv. Degrees of freedom
    v. Test statistic
    vi. p-value
    vii. Confidence interval in the difference in mean stem masses between watershed
    viii. Effect size  
    **(6 points)**  
    
### Problem 3. Personal data (12 points)

By now, you have some observations on your data sheet for your personal data. Even though it's early on in your data collection, it's a good idea to practice good **data management**. For this problem, you'll enter your data, read it into R, and create a visualization. If you get stuck at any step, you'll know there's something you need to fix.  

a. Create a spreadsheet to enter your data. Two good options include Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.  
b. Create the columns of your spreadsheet.  

:::{.callout-note}
#### Spreadsheet columns
If you organized your data sheet in "tidy format" (i.e. each row is an observation), then the columns of your spreadsheet would be exactly the same as the columns in your data sheet.
:::

c. Enter your data.  
d. Save your spreadsheet as a .csv file in your homework repository.  
e. Read your data into R.  
f. Create a visualization to explore your data. Finalize the plot. **(4 points)**  
g. In 1-2 sentences, describe what the "main message" of your visualization is. **(4 points)**  
h. In 2-4 sentences, describe the process of getting your data from your spreadsheet into R. Did you encounter any challenges? If so, why do you think those challenges arose, and how did you fix them? If not, why do you think your system for collecting your data worked? **(4 points)**  

:::{.callout-note}
#### Changing your data collection scheme
If you found that entering your data from your spreadsheet and getting it into the right format to be used in R was challenging, that's ok! This happens a lot with data collection. Feel free to change your data sheet so that you're collecting data in a way that makes your life easier as you're reading your data into R and using it.

### Problem 4. Statistical critique (10 points)
Check the [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGh39-AZ0RoEuY3VqjUQ_JORli-2wQ_O6EPRl20iy6k/edit?usp=sharing) and choose a paper to use for your critique based on An’s/Caitlin’s recommendations. Answer the following questions about the paper in 1-2 sentences each:  

a. Why were you interested in this paper? **(2 points)**  
b. What questions/hypotheses are the authors addressing? **(2 points)**  
c. What statistical tests are the authors doing? **(2 points)**  
d. Find the figure in the paper that is associated with the statistical tests from question (c). What are the x- and y-axes, and what does the figure show (i.e. what is the main message of the figure)? **(2 points)**  
e. Insert the figure into your homework document. **(2 points)**
