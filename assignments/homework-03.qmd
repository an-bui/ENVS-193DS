[Due on Sunday June 2 at 11:59 PM]{style="color: #79ACBD; font-size: 24px;"}

Read the instructions carefully and make sure you have all the components on the checklist.

## Set up

GitHub steps:  

1. Fork the workshop 8 repo on GitHub (link coming soon).  
2. Rename the repository to `lastname-firstname_homework-03`.  
3. Add An as a collaborator (username: an-bui).  

RStudio steps:
4. Clone your repository to your computer.  
5. Create a new Quarto document for your homework submission in the `code` folder.  
6. At the top of your document, include a link to your repository.  

Throughout the course of doing your homework, make at least 10 commits and pushes to the remote.  

## Problems

### Problem 1. Multiple linear regression: model selection and construction

Use the information from the `homework-starter-doc.qmd` to do this problem.

#### a. Make a table or list of all the models from class and the last one you constructed on your own with the predictors in each.

:::{.callout-note}
#### Double check your work!
There should be 5 models, including the null model.
:::

#### b. Write a 5-6 sentence "methods" section. Include:

- how you addressed the central question(s) (i.e. to examine the influence of ____, ____, and ____ on _____, I...)  
- how you chose the "best" model (i.e. to determine the model that best described ____, I...)  
- how you determined that your "best" model conformed to the assumptions of a linear model (i.e. to evaluate linear model assumptions, I...)  

#### c. Make a visualization of the model predictions with underlying data for your "best" model.  

Show and annotate all your code.

#### d. Write a caption for your visualization.  

Include a data citation, if necessary.  

#### e. Write a 3-4 sentence results section.

Address the following points:  
- what predictors "best" described total mass (include model statistics here)?  
- on average, what differences did you find between water treatments?  
- on average, what differences did you find between species?  

### Problem 2. affective visualization

In this problem, you will create an **affective visualization** using your personal data in preparation for workshop during week 10.  

In lecture, we talked about the three vertices of data visualization: 1) exploratory, 2) affective, and 3) communicative. We've done a lot of exploratory and communicative visualization, but have yet to think about affective visualization.  

When thinking of affective visualization, you can expand your ideas of what data visualization _could_ be. Some examples of affective visualizations include:  

- [Jill Pelto's paintings](https://www.jillpelto.com/gallery-1)  
- [Lorraine Woodruff-Long's warming strips quilt ](https://www.instagram.com/p/C689Kybxget/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)  
- [Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi's Dear Data project](https://www.dear-data.com/all)  

**Before starting, update your spreadsheet of observations.**  

#### a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data (3-5 sentences).

#### b. Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea.  

Include a photo of this sketch in your submission.  

#### c. Make a draft of your visualization.  

Feel free to be creative with this! _You do not have to do this in R._ You could create a sculpture, painting, textile object, etc.  

If you are making your visualization in R, show the annotated code and the output.  

If you are making your visualization outside of R, include a photo of your visualization in your submission.  

#### d. Write an artist statement.

An artist statement gives the audience context to understand your work. Write 4-5 sentences to address:  

- the content of your piece (what are you showing?)  
- the influences (what did techniques/artists/etc. did you find influential in creating your work?)  
- the form of your work (written code, watercolor, oil painting, etc.)  
- your process (how did you create your work?)  

### Problem 3. Statistical critique

At this point, you have seen and created a lot of figures for this class. Revisit the paper you chose for your critique and your homework 2, where you described figures or tables in the text. Address the following in full sentences (3-4 sentences each):

#### a. Revisit and summarize

What are the statistical tests the authors are using to address their main research question?  

Insert the figure or table you described in Homework 2 here.  

#### b. Visual clarity

How clearly did the authors _visually_ represent their statistics in figures? For example, are the x- and y-axes in a logical position? Do they show summary statistics (means and SE, for example) and/or model predictions, and if so, do they show the underlying data?  

#### c. Aesthetic clarity

How well did the authors handle "visual clutter"? How would you describe the the data:ink ratio?  

#### d. Recommendations (can be longer than 4 sentences)

What recommendations would you make to make the figure better? What would you take out, add, or change? Provide explanations/justifications for each of your recommendations.  

**Alternatively**, if they did not visually represent their statistics, what kind of figure would you recommend to them? Describe the x- and y-axes, with any geometries and aesthetics (colors, etc.). Provide enough explanation such that someone would be able to create the figure you describe in code. Provide explanations/justifications for the figure you would recommend.
