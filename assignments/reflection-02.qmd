In this assignment, youâ€™ll reflect on your own progress in the course up until this point.  

Reread your responses to reflection 1 and the feedback on Canvas. Then, address the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.

## Components

1. How have you progressed towards your learning goals for this course? Specifically, how do you know that you've made progress (for example, have you grown more confident in coding, have you applied statistics to new scenarios)?  

2. What skills are you proud of developing and/or building on in the last 7 weeks?  

3. Looking forward, how have your learning goals changed? Have they stayed the same?  

4. Have you learned anything into which you want to dive more deeply? Have you done so? If yes, what did you learn?  

5. Fill out the anonymous survey linked in the assignment description on Canvas, and answer the question at the end of the survey.  

## Checklist

Your reflection should:  

- address at least the 5 topics above (but please feel free to expand on these if you would like)  
- be uploaded to Canvas by 11:59 PM on Wednesday May 14 in PDF format
