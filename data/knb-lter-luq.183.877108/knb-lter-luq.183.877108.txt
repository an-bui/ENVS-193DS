            This is a long term monitoring of air temperature at each elevation plot along the Sonadora gradient. At each plot a HOBO sensor is located close to the middle of the plot: at 1m above ground: and placed inside a radiation shield (a plastic cup). Sensors are programmed to sample and store air temperature every hour. A daily average is computed from hourly readings. Sensors are downloaded twice a year: thus blanks represent sensor malfunction: loss of battery: or memory full. Initial blanks were due to lack of enough sensors to cover the gradient.

            Paired elevational transects (250 m to 1000 m) in the Sonadora River watershed were sampled at 50 m intervals to decouple underlying environmental gradients that are associated with changes in elevation and that are hypothesized to structure animal communities. One transect (mixed forest) reflected changes in abiotic and biotic conditions
