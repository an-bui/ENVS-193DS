  Pikas are captured, anesthetized, marked with colored ear-tags,
  non-lethally sampled, and released at point of capture during
  June-October. Study sites include a gradient of elevation and slope
  aspect, allowing a comparative study of pika response to variation in
  climate and sub-surface microclimate. Daily variation in snow cover
  and sub-surface temperatures are measured using data loggers placed
  within the territories of marked pikas. Focal territories are
  revisited at least once to characterize available vegetation via
  transect sampling and at least annually to service data loggers and
  record pika survival. Samples collected for genetic and physiological
  studies include ectoparasites, blood, saliva, urine, feces and hair as
  well as records of sex, stage, reproductive status, weight, foot
  length and body temperature.

  Procedures for trapping, marking, and sampling pikas are listed in the
  order in which they are performed. Sampling procedures requiring
  lighter anesthesia are performed last. Safety and sanitary procedures
  are followed during all phases of sampling, as outlined in training
  documents SOP_PikaProject_Safety_2014.docx (available from Chris Ray)
  and SOP_PikaProject_Sanitation_2014.docx (available from Chris Ray).

          
  1. Trapping. One or two traps (Model 201 collapsible wire mesh
  "chipmunk" trap by Tomahawk) are positioned near each
  targeted pikaís food cache. Trap locations are recorded by GPS and a
  list of each trapís location and schedule is retained by each of two
  crew members. Traps are left open only during daylight hours, and are
  locked shut or removed when we leave the study site. Each open trap is
  provisioned with enough moistened vegetation to sustain a pika for at
  least 6 hours. Open traps are checked every 2 hours and trapped pikas
  are handled and released as soon as possible. Each pika is released at
  point of capture, usually within 3 hours and never more than 6 hours
  after entering a trap. Pikas are released without handling if this
  timeline cannot be met. Pikas generally eat and remain calm while in
  traps, and each is allowed to self-transfer from the trap to the
  anesthetizing chamber.

          
  2. Anesthesia. Pikas are anesthetized via inhalant anesthetic
  (Isoflurane diluted in propylene glycol) using a custom drop chamber
  to obtain an effective dose of 0.5 mL/liter of chamber volume,
  increased to effect (exposure periods of up to 5 minutes at intervals
  of 5 to 10 minutes during a handling time of 5-35 minutes). A 2L,
  cylindrical and transparent main chamber is fitted on one end with a
  50 mL, perforated sub-chamber designed to deliver inhalant anesthetic
  while eliminating direct contact between the pika and the anesthetic
  in its liquid form. Two holes (each 5mm in diameter) in the main
  chamber are positioned to allow passive air exchange and CO2 drainage.
  A cotton ball in the sub-chamber is wetted with isoflurane diluted in
  propylene glycol to reduce vapor pressure (Itah et al. 2004). The high
  vapor pressure of pure isoflurane is associated with increased
  respiratory suppression and aversive behaviors that are controlled in
  pikas by lowering the vapor pressure during initial exposure to the
  drug. As suggested by Itah et al. (2004), we begin the anesthesia of
  each pika with a 20% v/v solution of isoflurane in propylene glycol,
  increasing the ratio of isoflurane only when needed to achieve effect.
  Effects are determined by observing the pika's breathing patterns and
  motor response to gentle rotation of the main chamber. Use of a
  transparent chamber also facilitates foot length measurement and the
  collection of ectoparasites that drop off in response to anesthesia.
  Effective anesthesia is achieved within 30 seconds after the pika
  fails to respond to chamber rotation. At this point, the pika is
  removed from the chamber for sampling. If aversive behaviors are
  observed during sampling, we repeat exposure to the anesthetic before
  proceeding. Doxapram (300 ug/pika) is administered intra-muscularly
  (in the thigh) as a respiratory stimulant if a pika ceases breathing
  and does not respond to tactile stimulation. Doxapram dosage for
  rabbits is commonly listed as 2-5 mg/kg delivered subcutaneously
  (e.g., Glennon and Jeffs 2001, Girling 2013), and there are multiple
  references for doxapram administered both sub-cutaneously (Carpenter
  2004, Huerkamp 1995) and intra-muscularly (Plumb 2011, Clark et al.
  2014). Intra-muscular injection is recommended due to improved blood
  access to the muscle relative to subcutaneous tissues (Redig 1993).
  Euthanasia (rare) is accomplished via Isoflurane overdose, followed by
  removal of vital organs to ensure death. Euthanized animals are
  transferred to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center (6006
  Schroeder Road, Madison, Wisconsin 53711-6223; phone 608-270-2400) for
  necropsy. Necropsy reports are forwarded to the CU Campus
  Veterinarian. During processing of live pikas, adverse responses are
  identified by constant monitoring of respiratory rate/regularity,
  muscle tension, mucous membrane color, and response to gentle tactile
  stimuli. Constant monitoring is possible because several personnel
  attend the sampling of each pika. Rectal temperature, taken once near
  the beginning of sampling procedures, is used to guide monitoring. The
  most likely adverse outcomes involving pikas are shock and heat
  stroke. Shock is a common response to stress in lagomorphs, and stress
  can sometimes quickly elevate the pikaís relatively high resting body
  temperature to a lethal level. Symptoms of shock in lagomorphs include
  pale gums, cool extremities, increased breathing, increased heart rate
  and a weak pulse. Symptoms of heat stroke in lagomorphs include rapid
  breathing, shallow breathing, drooling, pale gums, prostration and
  weakness. Pikas can also exhibit additional symptoms such as labored
  breathing and rigid muscles (e.g., an arched back). Adverse responses
  are treated as follows: a) Hyperthermia - Apply water or alcohol to
  the dorsal fur, supply shade and air movement, and treat for shock. b)
  Hypothermia - Warm the animal using a chemical heat pack (hand warmer)
  insulated if necessary to modulate heat transfer. c) Shock - Initiate
  gentle tactile stimulation of respiration and blood flow by stroking
  the spine with your fingertips. 25-501-2 ml of lactated ringer
  solution injected sub-cutaneously can support cardiac output and
  cooling. d) Cardiac and respiratory arrest - Initiate a modified
  version of CPR to aid respiration and blood flow. Isolate the animal
  from any anesthetic and blow human breath lightly toward its face and
  fan the face gently while stroking the spine with your fingertips,
  followed (if necessary) by pumping (contracting and extending) the
  animal's forelegs toward and away from its heart. If these steps do
  not immediately restore relaxed muscles and regular breathing, inject
  Doxapram as described above. e) Skin injuries - Wounds are flushed
  with dilute betadine and skin glue can be used in extreme cases (not
  yet encountere). f) Consult the campus veterinarian if any pikas
  appear unusually affected by procedures.

          
  3. Sexing and demographic assessment. We determine sex by manual
  inversion of the cloaca to reveal the genitalia. Stage is determined
  from physical metrics and molting patterns, which differ markedly
  between juveniles (&amp;amp;lt;1 year old) and adults. Reproductive
  status is determined by palpating testes and examining nipples for
  evidence of lactation.

          
  4. Recording body temperature. A rectal thermometer designed for
  children is inserted into the anus immediately after sexing to record
  body temperature. We have found rectal temperatures to be more
  reliable than ear temperatures measured with an infrared thermometer.

          
  5. Ear tagging and tissue sampling. A small disk of tissue (about 1 mm
  in diameter) is removed from the ear using a commercial punch designed
  for this purpose, and a commercial rabbit-ear tag (colored and
  numbered uniquely for each individual) is inserted through this hole
  to allow re-sight studies of individual survival and behavior. Ear
  tissue is used for genetic studies.

          
  6. Ectoparasite collection. Pikas often host a group of ear mites that
  attach to the outer ear and appear as a continuous orange scab or
  crust. Tweezers are used to remove a small portion of this crust
  (about 1 mm in diameter). Fleas (common) and other free-ranging
  ectoparasites (rare) are collected as they rise from the pikaís fur or
  drop into the anesthetizing chamber or handling tray. Ticks (rare) are
  pulled using tweezers. Each taxonomic group is stored separately in
  alcohol.

          
  7. Retro-orbital bleeding. We draw ~200 µl of blood from each pika
  using heparinized capillary tubes. This is a one-time draw
  representing 0.5-5% of the circulating blood volume of pikas weighing
  50-200 g. Samples are obtained from pikas under anesthesiathe right
  eye by retro-orbital abrasion performed by the PI. Consistent sampling
  of only the right eye facilitates post-release studies of eye
  condition. Pikas are prone to die of shock induced by pressure on the
  body. To reduce this risk, we restrain only 3 points on the skull by
  laying the pika on its left side on a handling tray and applying
  slight pressure with the left index finger on the brow bone above the
  pikaís right eye, left thumb on the cheek bone below the pikaís right
  eye, and first knuckle of the left middle finger behind the pikaís
  head below a protuberance at the base of the skull. When held in this
  way, a pika generally remains relaxed throughout retro-orbital
  bleeding even under light anesthesia. Samples of sufficient volume
  (&amp;amp;gt;150 µl) are split into 2 vials, with a smaller volume
  stored as whole blood and a larger volume immediately centrifuged to
  separate plasma from red blood cells. Plasma is used for a variety of
  analyses including quantification of glucocorticoid hormones and
  heat-shock proteins. Whole blood is used for disease studies including
  analyses of extra- and intracellular essential elements. An additional
  drop of whole blood is used to prepare a smear for microscopy to
  determine blood cell counts and cell morphology. Excess blood is used
  to wet a Nobuto strip for dry storage and pathogen analyses.

          
  8. PIT-tagging. The pika is scruffed to raise loose skin at the back
  of the neck where a commercial Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT)
  tag is inserted via sterile syringe after the insertion area is wetted
  thoroughly with a cotton ball soaked in 70% ethyl alcohol.

          
  9. Collection of urine and feces. Fecal pellets, caecal feces and
  urine are collected opportunistically (not induced) during handling
  and from the trap, for analyses of stress metrics, parasites and diet.

          
  10. Collection of saliva, hair and mass data. The pika is held loosely
  in a mesh bag (of known weight) and weighed to the nearest gram using
  a spring scale with hook. The bag is then set on a firm surface and a
  cotton-tipped swab is inserted through the mesh into the pikaís mouth
  and manipulated to obtain an adequate sample of saliva. Unlike
  rodents, pikas do not drool in response to anesthesia, but they are
  generally calm while providing a sample by chewing on the swab. Saliva
  is used for analyses of stress metrics. Finally, we insert tweezers
  through the mesh to sample a small clump of hair (~100 hairs) from the
  rump for genetic and isotope (diet) studies.

          
  11. Release at point of capture. Until fully recovered from
  anesthesia, the pika is held in the mesh handling bag under a blind
  providing shade and/or insulation to reduce stress and counter any
  adverse ambient conditions. When recovered, the pika is carried in the
  mesh handling bag and a blind sack to point of capture for release.
  Point of capture is recorded via GPS and recorded along with all other
  sampling data in the PIís annual field notebook.

          
  12. Observational studies. Each pika is uniquely identified by its
  ear-tag colors, and each territorial adult is also closely identified
  with its point of capture. We revisit each point of capture to observe
  tagged pika survival and behavior, and to position 1-3 sensors to log
  temperature, light and humidity within focal pika territories (data
  loggers are small, &amp;amp;lt;4x8x12 cm, and territories are not
  significantly modified by their placement). Focal territories are
  revisited at least once to characterize available vegetation via
  transect sampling and at least annually to service data loggers,
  record pika survival, characterize cache contents via visual or
  limited physical sampling, and observe pika behaviors.

          
  13. Data and sample maintenance. Each sample is marked with an
  accession number comprised of the year and unique ear-tag color
  combination of the corresponding pika. Hair, tissue and Nobuto-strip
  blood samples are stored in paper coin envelopes with desiccant.
  Ectoparasites are stored in alcohol, separated by taxonomic group. All
  other samples are stored in vials on ice in the field and transferred
  promptly to a -20 deg C freezer (Andrew Martin Lab, CU). Sampling data
  from each pika is entered into a spreadsheet in association with the
  accession number. Data from observational studies are entered into
  separate spreadsheets in association with appropriate accession
  numbers and/or GPS coordinates. Microclimate data are accumulated as
  comma-delimited text files for manipulation by script. We are
  currently designing a relational database to accommodate all records
  associated with this project.

  Code/variable explanation:

          
  Location - WK = West Knoll on Niwot Ridge, CO, the highest site
  included in this study, with multiple slope aspects; LL = Long Lake, a
  north-facing site just below the lower north-facing WK site; ML =
  Mitchell Lake, a south-facing site just above Mitchell Lake and at an
  elevation similar to the LL site; CG = Cable Gate, a south-facing site
  just upslope of the final parking lot on the Niwot Ridge road.

          
  Slope Aspect - General aspect of the successful trap location (see
  Easting and Northing), reported in terms of cardinal directions (e.g.,
  NNW means the slope faces NW, but closer to N than W).

          
  Easting/Northing - GPS coordinates of the successful trap location,
  reported in UTM (datum WGS84 zone 13).

          
  Tag Type - Type of tag or unique mark used to identify this pika from
  other pikas: A = aluminum "rabbit" tag (from National Band
  and Tag) combined with colored washer (front/inside of ear) and
  colored strip of plastic (back/outside of ear); C = ear-notching code
  (used when tags not available).

          
  Color Code Right Ear- Colors associated with tag (color on inside or
  "front" of ear followed by color on outside or
  "back" of ear), or code determined by notching pattern
  visible along the edge of the ear; R = red, B = blue, Y = yellow, W =
  white, G = green; 1-1, 0-1, or 1-0 = # of notches forward of (above)
  and aft of (below) central location along outer rim of ear.
  "N" means "Notch" and refers to pikas with large
  natural notches in their ears from fights or from a previous tag that
  pulled out; notched ears cannot be tagged, so the notch is recorded
  for future pika identification.  Some other ear-codes: "H"
  means "Hole" (another type of ear-marking that can result
  from a tag pulling out), and "M" means "Mangled"
  (ear disfigured from fights or ear-mites).

          
  Color Code Left Ear - Same as above, but for left ear. Both ears were
  always marked, due to the potential for tag loss and natural ear
  damage. This protocol ensures that a pika that has lost its tags can
  always be identified as previously tagged, as opposed to having
  natural ear damage.

          
  Number Right Ear - "N" means "Notch" and refers to
  pikas with large natural notches in their ears from fights or from a
  previous tag that pulled out; notched ears cannot be tagged, so the
  notch is recorded for future pika identification.  Some other
  ear-codes: "H" means "Hole" (another type of
  ear-marking that can result from a tag pulling out), and "M"
  means "Mangled" (ear disfigured from fights or ear-mites).

          
  Number Left Ear - Same as above, but for left ear.

          
  Weight - Body weight (grams) as determined by weighing the pika in a
  bag and subtracting bag weight. Bags are tared regularly in the field.

          
  Stage - Stage (A = adult &amp;amp;gt;= 1 year old, J = juvenile
  &amp;amp;lt; 1 year old) as determined through observations OTHER THAN
  weight, including molt status (juveniles molt later in the year than
  adults), tenor of voice (juveniles have relatively high-pitched
  calls), size (relative to adults), physical proportions (juveniles are
  more fusiform with head and neck relatively large), size of fecal
  pellets, and/or haying and defensive behaviors.

          
  Sex - Sex (M = male, F = female) as determined through inversion of
  cloaca or (rarely) through aural means (males use a "long
  call" and females may respond in a typical way during this call)
  and/or appearance of nipples. The male penis is usually longer than
  the female clitoris. The penis is usually sheathed at the base. The
  clitoris is usually more triangular in profile. Nipples are apparent
  usually only on females that have lactated (otherwise, nipples are
  concealed by dense ventral fur).

          
  Reproductive Status - P = pregnant (enlarged abdomen), L = has
  lactated this year (nipples visible &amp;amp;amp; hairless), T =
  testes (about the size of a jellybean) detected by feel, U = no
  evidence of recent reproduction.

          
  Ear-mites Sampled - Whether mites were collected (1=collected, 0=not
  collected). Several mites were collected at once (using tweezers to
  pinch the skin under a cluster of mites) and were stored separately
  from other ectoparasites in a vial of ethanol or isopropyl alcohol.

          
  Ear-mite Cover - Mites cluster in the ear, covering the ear tissue to
  some degree. Cover is estimated as N = none, L = low (&amp;amp;lt;4 sq
  mm), M = medium (&amp;amp;lt;16 sq mm) or H = high (&amp;amp;gt;16 sq
  mm).

          
  Fleas Sampled - Number of fleas collected. Fleas are anesthetized by
  the oral anesthetic used on the pika, and are collected from the
  handling tray or anesthetizing chamber. Fleas were stored together,
  but separately from other ectoparasites. Fleas were stored in a vial
  of 70% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol.

          
  Fleas Observed - Number of fleas observed, sometimes greater than the
  number successfully collected.

          
  Tissue Sampled - Whether tissue samples were collected (1 = collected,
  0 = not collected). Tissue samples were taken from the ear, resulting
  either from the hole made in the center of the ear in preparation for
  the ear tag or from a notch made in the rim of the ear. Tissue samples
  were kept dry and stored in paper envelopes.

          
  Hair Sampled - Whether hair samples were collected (1 = collected, 0 =
  not collected). Hair samples were taken from the rump, in a cluster,
  using a pair of tweezers. Hair samples were usually added to the paper
  envelope containing the ear sample(s), but separate hair samples were
  also collected after 2011.

          
  Urine Sampled - Whether urine was collected (1 = collected, 0 = not
  collected). Urine was stored in a vial on ice and transferred to
  ultra-cold storage. Additional notes are available regarding number of
  vials, vial labeling, and collection locations (rock under trap, tarp
  used to carry trap, handling tray, or anesthetizing chamber).

          
  Feces Sampled Dry Pellets - Whether dry pellets were collected (1 =
  collected, 0 = not collected). Dry pellets were those not apparently
  exposed to pika urine. All fecal samples were placed in vials,
  separating types of feces and even instances of a sampled type. Vials
  were stored on ice and transferred to an ultra-cold freezer. See notes
  for number of vials, vial labeling, and collection locations (rock
  under trap, tarp used to carry trap, handling tray, or anesthetizing
  chamber).

          
  Feces Sampled Wet Pellets - Whether wet pellets were collected (1 =
  collected, 0 = not collected). Wet pellets were those exposed to pika
  urine. All fecal samples were placed in vials, separating types of
  feces and even instances of a sampled type. Vials were stored on ice
  and transferred to an ultra-cold freezer. See notes for number of
  vials, vial labeling, and collection locations (rock under trap, tarp
  used to carry trap, handling tray, or anesthetizing chamber).

          
  Feces Sampled Caecal - Whether caecal feces were collected (1 =
  collected, 0 = not collected). Caecal feces are usually reingested by
  pikas, and contain valuable nutrients. All fecal samples were placed
  in vials, separating types of feces and even instances of a sampled
  type. Vials were stored on ice and transferred to an ultra-cold
  freezer. Additional notes are available concerning number of vials,
  vial labeling, and collection locations (rock under trap, tarp used to
  carry trap, handling tray, or anesthetizing chamber).

          
  Blood Sampled Retro-orbital - Whether blood was collected via
  retro-orbital bleeding (1 = collected, 0 = not collected). Blood was
  blown out of capillary tubes into a vial and usually centrifuged to
  separate plasma from red blood cells. Plasma was then drawn off of
  centrifuged samples using a clean capillary and stored in a separate
  vial. Only the right eye was bled, to facilitate tracking potential
  eye damage during field observations. Prior to centrifugation, blood
  was stored in a cooler with ice, but not in direct contact with the
  ice, to avoid bursting red blood cells. After centrifugation, both
  products were stored on ice and transferred to an ultra-cold freezer.

          
  Blood Sampled Ear-punch - Whether blood was collected from the ear (1
  = collected, 0 = not collected). This was done, rather than
  retro-orbital bleeding, in rare cases when enough blood was produced
  as a result of punching a hole in the ear in preparation for ear
  tagging. This collection method is not as antiseptic as retro-orbital
  bleeding, and usually produced too little blood for analyses. After
  2009, we often used the smaller amounts of blood produced by ear
  tagging to prepare a slide with a smear of whole blood for microscopic
  analysis. Blood was blown out of capillary tubes into a vial and
  usually centrifuged to separate plasma from red blood cells. Plasma
  was then drawn off using a clean capillary and stored in a separate
  vial. Prior to centrifugation, blood was stored in a cooler with ice,
  but not in direct contact with the ice, to avoid bursting red blood
  cells. After centrifugation, both products were stored on ice and
  transferred to an ultra-cold freezer.

          
  Smear - Whether we used a drop of blood to prepare a slide with a
  smear of whole blood for microscopic analysis. Slides were prepared in
  the field using whole blood immediately after sampling.

          
  Nobuto - Whether we saturated a Nobuto strip with whole blood during
  the sampling process. Nobuto strips were allowed to air-dry during
  sampling and were stored dry in paper envelopes.

          
  Saliva Sampled - Whether saliva was collected using a cotton swab (1 =
  collected, 0 = not collected). We forced the swab into the mouth and
  swept it all around, forcing the pika to gnaw on it. Even so, very
  little saliva was collected. The swab was stored in a vial on ice and
  transferred to ultra-cold storage.

          
  Rectal Temperature - Body temperature (Celsius) measured using a
  rectal thermometer made for human babies. When using a rectal
  thermometer, some measurements were from the cloaca rather than the
  rectum (verified by feces on the thermometer). Readings from the
  cloaca often seemed too low.

          
  Neck Circumference - Circumference (cm) of the neck, measured using a
  string or fabric circling the neck and overlapped such that a single
  pen stroke could mark the point of overlap. The distance between marks
  on the string was then measured. These measurements are for planning
  the construction of collars for tracking these animals, so the string
  was tightened sufficiently to ensure the collar could not be slipped.

          
  Foot Length - Length (mm) of left hind foot, measured using a tape
  while the foot was pressed against the clear anesthetizing chamber.

          
  NS - These data are not available because this pika was not sampled in
  this way. Note the important distinction between NS and NA.

          
  NA - These data were not recorded in the main trapping notebook
  (curated by Chris Ray, cray@colorado.edu). In some cases, these data
  may be found or inferred from information available in other
  notebooks.
