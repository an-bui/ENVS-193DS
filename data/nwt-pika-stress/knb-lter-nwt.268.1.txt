  Temporal variation in a metric of stress might signify changes in an
  organism’s internal or external environment, but spatial variation in
  stress response could also signify spatial variation in habitat
  quality. Any stress response to habitat quality can be complicated or
  modulated, however, by strategies like escape in space (e.g., animal
  movements) or time (e.g., seed banks) that allow access to different
  conditions. Spatial and temporal variation in response to potential
  stressors has received little study in wild animals, especially at
  scales appropriate for relating stress to specific habitat
  characteristics. Here, we use the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a
  highly territorial small mammal, to investigate stress response within
  and among territories. For individually territorial animals such as
  pika, differences in habitat quality should lead to differences in the
  levels of stress exhibited by territory owners. In this study, we
  indexed stress by measuring stress hormone metabolites in feces
  collected non-invasively from pika territories. Feces were collected
  from 20 territories every two weeks from June to September of 2018
  (pika_fecal_glut.aw.data.csv). In 2019, habitat metrics were recorded
  at each territory (pika_fecal_glut_habitat.aw.data.csv).

  American pika (Ochotona princeps) are individually territorial and do
  not migrate after establishing a territory (Smith &amp; Weston 1990).
  Pika territories are relatively small (14-34 m in diameter; Smith and
  Weston 1990) and are generally centered on a winter food cache or
  ‘haypile’ of graminoids (such as grasses) and forbs (flowering plants)
  that are harvested during the growing season and consumed over winter
  (Huntly et al. 1986, Dearing 1996). We delineated a pika territory by
  identifying an active, main haypile at the center. Fecal pellet
  sampling stations (hereafter, stations) were established at haypiles.
  Each station was separated by at least 50 m, which we assumed to
  belong to different individuals occupying distinct territories.

          
  Pika produce two types of feces, the first being a soft cecal feces
  that is re-ingested and later deposited as firm pellets (Smith and
  Weston 1990; Nichols 2010). We collected only fresh, adult-sized
  pellets from 20 stations. Each station was visited once every two
  weeks from June 8 through September 4, 2018. During each visit, fresh
  pellets were collected if available, and other pellets were cleared to
  facilitate identification of fresh pellets on subsequent visits.
  Samples were stored in paper envelopes labeled with sampling date and
  coordinates. We attempted to collect 10-15 pellets per sample (0.1
  grams total) to facilitate glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) analyses
  and genetic analyses. Samples were stored at -20°C until analyzed. To
  measure GCM concentrations in fecal pellet samples, we used a
  commercially available Corticosterone Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (cat. no.
  K014-H5; Arbor Assay Design, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). GCM concentrations
  were reported in picograms/gram of dried feces. To determine sex, we
  sent a subset of fecal pellets to the Alisa Hove lab at Warren Wilson
  College to perform genetic analyses.

          
  Habitat metrics were recorded using the protocol developed for the
  pika habitat occupancy survey at Niwot LTER (“NWT LTER Pika Survey
  Manual.docx”, Ray 2019). The fecal pellet sampling station was the
  center point for each habitat survey.
