It allows you to write your code (recipe) and run the code in the console (kitchen).\nR considers everything in the script as code to run, so you can write comments in the R Script by putting a pound sign at the beginning of the line. This is especially useful when you want to explain what your code is doing at each line in plain language.\nTry writing a comment of your own in the line below.\n\n# This is a comment!\n\n\n\n2. Intro to functions\nR allows you to apply functions to do calculations, from simple to complex structures.

Raptor abundance between restoration plots (10 points)\nManagers at Coal Oil Point Reserve (COPR) are interested in the relationship between restored areas and raptor abundance: as different parts of the reserve are restored to native grassland, small mammal (i.e. mice, gopher, vole) abundances should increase, which should attract more raptors (i.e. hawks, falcons) to the reserve. You conduct weekly surveys for raptors at COPR from April to June in one of the restoration areas and collect the following data on the number of raptors you see for each survey:\n\\[\n0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 0\n\\]\n\nWhat kind of data did you collect, and why?

    "text": "Optional check in due on Wednesday April 3 (Week 1) at 11:59 PM\nIn this class, we’ll be using R and RStudio to code up our statistical analyses. Walk through these steps to make sure you have both programs on your computer and that everything is working properly. You need to make sure these tasks are completed before workshop on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo these set up steps as soon as possible!\n\n\n\nEveryone needs to do tasks 1 - 7. If you want to submit the optional check-in for Caitlin/An to verify that you’ve done things correctly, you can do task 8 and submit your screenshot on Canvas.\nIf you do not have R, RStudio, and Quarto installed and running, we cannot stop for you. Do this before class starts!\n\n\n\nTask 1. Install R, RStudio, and Quarto\nIf you already have both things installed, great. If not, follow these instructions:\n\nFor MacOS, do set up steps 1-3 here\n\nFor Windows, do set up steps 1-3 here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Quarto\n\n\n\nIf you cannot install Quarto on your computer (because it doesn’t work with your operating system, etc.), that is fine - you just might have some differences between what we do in class and what you see on your own computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating existing programs\n\n\n\nYou may want to update your R and RStudio version if you haven’t used either in the last year or so. If not, some of the packages we use in the class might not work with your set up.\n\n\n\n\nTask 2. Open RStudio\nWhen we say we’re “using R” in the class, what we’re really using is RStudio, which is a graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the language). Basically, we’re never going to open up “R”, but we’ll always open up “RStudio”.\nOpen RStudio on your computer.\n\n\nTask 3. Change your workspace save settings\nWhen you’re using RStudio, you’ll get the option to “save your workspace” if you close out of the program. We’re going to make sure you don’t do that, because we want to make sure our code runs independently of any old information that was saved on your computer from RStudio.\nGo to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; General and make sure that:\n\n“Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup” is unchecked\n\n“Save workspace to .RData on exit” is on “Never”\n\nHit “Apply”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4. Change your color scheme\nYou don’t have to stick with the boring RStudio color scheme! Go to Appearance (from Tools &gt; Global Options) and choose an Editor Theme. Hit “Apply” to save it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5. Test out installing a package\nPackages are the best part of using R. We’ll talk more about what packages are in workshop, but for now try installing a package. Go to your Console (the bottom left pane in the RStudio window), and type (or copy paste) install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). Hit Enter.\nYou should get a message that looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating system differences\n\n\n\nThe database that holds all these packages will automatically detect which version you need based on your operating system. Don’t worry if your output message doesn’t look exactly the same as the one here - just as long as you get something like “The downloaded binary packages are in…”, you’ve probably got the package installed.\n\n\n\n\nTask 6. Test out reading in a package\nNow you’ve installed a package, but you want to make sure you can actually run it. Again in the Console (the bottom left pane), type library(tidyverse) and hit Enter.\nYou should get a message that looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 7. Set up a folder on your computer for class materials\nUsing R/RStudio requires you to know how your computer is organized and where your files are. For now, we’ll want to set up a folder in your computer called ENVS-193DS (note no spaces in the folder name).\nAll operating systems are different, but make sure that your folder is not in the “iCloud” or “Google Drive” folders in your computer. Basically, you want to be sure that you can get from your “root” directory (i.e. your actual computer hard drive) to the folder you’re using.\nYou can check this using the file path, or the folders you would need to open to get to the folder called ENVS-193DS. One example for MacOS is below, where the file path is written out at the bottom of the pane:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 8. Take a screenshot of your RStudio set up\nSo that the instructors can verify that you’ve gotten everything set up, take a screenshot of your RStudio window with the code for install.packages(\"tidyverse\") and library(tidyverse) in your Console and submit it to the portal on Canvas. Your screenshot should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble check your screenshot!\n\n\n\nMake sure that the messages in the orange box (above) are visible in your screenshot! Otherwise we will not be able to troubleshoot whatever issues you are having with installation (if you are actually having any)."

(4 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\nHint 1: the geom you’ll need to create a scatter plot is geom_point().\nHint 2: the x-axis will be Year and the y-axis will be Cumu_sea_rise. Where do these go? Check out your workshop code from Wednesday the 12th.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3. Setting up statistical critique (6 points)\nThroughout the quarter, you’ll engage in a critique of statistical methods for a published paper. Some methods are appropriate for the data and research questions, and some are not. You’ll be the judge!\nFor this homework assignment, you will find 3 candidate papers for your critique. Find 3 papers that speak to your interests - the paper could be on human health, plant restoration, agroecology, or more. Anything you might be interested in within the realm of environmental studies is fair game. Not all 3 papers have to be on the same topic.\n\nFor each paper, skim the Methods section, looking for information on statistical analysis. A paper is a good choice if it includes one of these terms (or something similar) in the analysis description:\n\nt-test\n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA)\n\nMann-Whitney U\n\nKruskal-Wallis\n\nLinear model or linear regression\n\nSpearman correlation\n\nPearson correlation\n\nGeneralized linear mixed effect model\n\nOnce you’ve verified that your paper includes one of the above listed terms, find the digital object identifier (DOI), which is a unique identifier in the form of a URL for a paper. You will know it is a DOI if it has doi.org somewhere in the URL.\n\nOnce you find the DOIs for all 3 papers, add them to the Google form. Repeat this for all three papers. (3 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want to see what other people have chosen, see the class responses here.\n\n\n\nIn your homework document, list the papers in alphabetical order by author last name. (3 points)\nYour citations should take the form:\nLast name, first name, et al. Year. “Paper title.” Journal title volume:issue.\nExample:\nSanford, E., et al. 2019. “Widespread shifts in the coastal biota of northern California during the 2014–2016 marine heatwaves.” Scientific Reports 9:4216."

    "title": "Setting up GitHub pages",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Why set up GitHub pages?\nIf you render/knit your documents to html, someone else who wants to see your document will have to fork/clone your repo into their computer, and open up your html document. By setting up GitHub pages, you can essentially make your repository into a website and create a URL to your rendered html document. Then, if you want to share your code, someone can just look at the page on that URL and not have to deal with your whole repository.\nIn class, we walked through the simplest way to set up GitHub pages. However, there are lots of advanced options to make your repository into a website. For example, in CHOYOA 2, you’ll set some different options when you set up GitHub pages.\n\n\n1. Create a new repository on GitHub\nMake sure you have the repository set to be public and that you are adding a README.\n\n\n\n2. Set up GitHub pages\nNavigate to the main page of your repository. Click on Settings &gt; Pages. Select your main branch as the deployed branch. Click save.\n\nYou know that this worked if you get a message at the top of the window saying “GitHub Pages source saved.”\n\n\n3. Clone your repo to your computer and create some code.\nIn the demo, we put all our code into a new folder in the repo called code. Then, create a new Quarto/RMarkdown document and make sure it is saved as either an HTML (ideal) or a PDF (also works but not as aesthetically pleasing). Save that document in the code folder.\n\n\n\n4. Adjust the YAML options.\nThere are lots of document options you can adjust in the metadata. In class, we went through how to set global options for code chunks using execute:.\n\nIn RMarkdown: this happens in the knitr set up chunk:\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)\n\n\n\n5. Render/knit your code.\nNote the file path for the .qmd document is: code/newcode.qmd. That means the file path for the .html document is: code/newcode.html.\n\n\n\n6. Stage/commit/push those changes\nIf you are using Quarto, you’ll see a lot of files for the rendered plots, formatting options, etc. If you are using RMarkdown, you won’t. This is just a little difference between Quarto and RMarkdown.\n\n\n\n7. Return to GitHub and look at the environment\nGo back to your repository on GitHub. You should see two visual cues that this has worked:\n1. You have a brown circle by your most recent commit. This corresponds to what’s happening in…\n2. The “Environments”. You will see github-pages marked as “active”.\n\n\n\n8. Check the deployment\nClick on github-pages under Environments. You should see that the deployment (your commit/push) shows up as “Queued”. This will eventually turn into “In Progress”, then “Active”.\n\nNote: depending how how many other actions are happening on GitHub at any given time, this may take a couple minutes. Be patient! Eventually it will be active.\n\n\n9. Look at the your rendered document!\nYour deployed repository will have the URL your-github-username.github.io/repository-name. In this example, the URL is an-bui.github.io/my-repository.\nTo find your rendered html document, use the file path as your URL. In this example, the file path to the rendered document is code/newcode.html. This means the URL for the .html on my deployed repository is an-bui.github.io/my-repository/code/newcode.html.\n\nNote: sometimes it’s useful to link this URL in the README!\n\n\nexample repo\nThe repo for this example is here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{bui2023,\n  author = {Bui, An},\n  title = {Setting up {GitHub} Pages},\n  date = {2023-05-17},\n  url = {https://an-bui.github.io/ES-193DS-W23/resources/github-pages.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBui, An. 2023. “Setting up GitHub Pages.” May 17, 2023. https://an-bui.github.io/ES-193DS-W23/resources/github-pages.html."

The following are examples from lecture. You’ve also done a lot of reading in this class, and have seen a lot of examples of how to communicate about statistics from other researchers.\nEach code chunk with what is potentially new information is annotated - however, I haven’t annotated things like tests, creating plots, etc. because we’ve gone over that in class.\n\n\nCode\n# general use\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# data\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# visualization\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(flextable)\n\n# model summary table tools\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(equatiomatic)\n\n# using the Lato font from Google fonts\nlibrary(showtext)\nfont_add_google(\"Lato\", \"Lato\")\nshowtext_auto()"

Dashed red line represents theoretical mean (\\(\\mu\\) = 0). B) Quantile-quantile (QQ) plot. Points in QQ plot represent sample quantiles compared against theoretical quantiles from a normal distribution. Solid black line represents a 1:1 relationship between sample and theoretical quantiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking sure your figures render properly\n\n\n\n\n\nYou put a lot of effort into making figures, so it’s worth making sure they appear the way you think they would in your final document! You can control these in your chunk options (i.e. within the curly brackets). There are many ways to do this, but I like adjusting the a) aspect ratio using fig.width and fig.height and b) proportion using out.width.\nIn Quarto, you can set those options within the chunk (see above) or in the curly brackets. In RMarkdown, you can only use the curly brackets, which would look like:\n{r fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6, out.width = \"90%\", fig.align = \"center\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormatting captions\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can write a caption in text (the easiest way) or you can try using code chunk options if you’re using Quarto. There are tips for how to do that here, though the formatting might not be the standard (i.e. bold text for figure number and title). I also changed the caption color - not required, but nice to add another visual cue that the caption is attached to the figure.\nGenerally, the font size in captions tends to be smaller than the main text. You can insert these options in Quarto by wrapping your text in a “fenced div” (see the source code for how to do that). In RMarkdown, you can use an HTML wrapper (here’s an example).\n\n\n\nExample text:\nWe visually assessed normality using a histogram and a QQ plot (Figure 1), and determined that acorn mass in our sample was normally distributed.\n\n\nTest\n\n\nCode\nacorn_test &lt;- t.test(acorns, mu = 2)\n\n\nExample text:\nWe assessed whether acorn masses in our sample differed from the claim of 2g using a one-sample two-tailed t-test. Our null hypothesis was that the mean acorn mass in our sample was the same as the claim.\n\n\nTest results\n\n\nCode\nacorn_test\n\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  acorns\nt = 1.8035, df = 40, p-value = 0.07885\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 2\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 1.964535 2.623323\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 2.293929 \n\n\nExample text:\nWe collected 41 acorns and found no significant difference between our sample mean mass and the claim (One-sample two-tailed t-test, t(40) = 1.8, \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05, p = 0.079). Our data suggest that acorn masses in our sampling area are on average the same mass as the claimed mass (Figure 1A)."

ANOVA is fairly robust against violations of the normality assumption, and we have a lot of observations. We might decide to continue with the ANOVA (especially since the variances between groups are equal - see below). However, you could also try a transformation (e.g. a log transformation) on bill length, and see if that fixes your problem.\n\n\n\nChecking for equal variances:\n\n\nCode\nleveneTest(bill_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)\n\n\nLevene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)\n       Df F value Pr(&gt;F)\ngroup   2  2.2425 0.1078\n      339               \n\n\nExample text:\n Prior to our analysis, we checked assumptions for analysis of variance. We tested for equality of variances between groups using Levene’s test and found no statistically significant differences in variances between groups (F(2, 339) = 2.24, p = 0.11, \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05). We visually assessed normality using histograms and QQ plots (Figure 2) and statistically tested for normality of penguin bill length using Shapiro-Wilk tests for each species. Adelie and Chinstrap bill length did not indicate any deviations from normality (Adelie: W W = 0.99, p = 0.72; Chinstrap: W = 0.98, p = 0.19), but Gentoo bill length did (W = 0.97, p = 0.01). Taking this together, we decided to continue using analysis of variance given our sample size (n = 342) and that analysis of variance tends to be robust to slight violations of the normality assumption.Note that you only really need to state your \\(\\alpha\\) once in a report. The assumption is that you’re not changing your significance level for each test.\n\n\nTest\nANOVA:\n\n\nCode\npenguins_anova &lt;- aov(bill_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)\n\n\nTukey HSD:\n\n\nCode\npenguins_HSD &lt;- TukeyHSD(penguins_anova)\n\n\nExample text:\nWe tested for differences between penguin species in bill length using analysis of variance. Our null hypothesis was that species did not differ in mean bill length. We used Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (Tukey HSD) as a post-hoc test to determine pair-wise differences between groups.\n\n\nTest results\n\n\nCode\npenguins_anova\n\n\nCall:\n   aov(formula = bill_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)\n\nTerms:\n                 species Residuals\nSum of Squares  7194.317  2969.888\nDeg. of Freedom        2       339\n\nResidual standard error: 2.959853\nEstimated effects may be unbalanced\n2 observations deleted due to missingness\n\n\nANOVA table:\nExample caption:\n\nTable 2.

In multiple linear regression (and for more complex models), it’s a good idea to include a table of the model summary.\nIf you wanted to make a table of the model estimates and the relevant information at the bottom of that summary (for example, \\(R^2\\), F-statistic, degrees of freedom, etc.), you could use flextable::as_flextable() which takes the model object - this is Table 3. This skips the step of creating an intermediate data frame and just turns everything into a flextable object. However, this can be a bit tricky: the formatting to make it look “good” takes some getting used to. You can go either way, but this is one option if you’d rather condense the information from the model prediction table and ANOVA table into one. It is also somewhat easier to interpret than the model prediction + ANOVA table combo (Tables 4 + 5).\n\n\n\nTable option 2:\nTable 4. Model prediction table.

In A), growth is predicted as a function of temperature for a constant light level of 0.98 watts/m2 and pH 7. In B), growth is predicted as a function of light for a constant temperature of 27.9 °C and pH 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding predictions\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that for multiple linear regression, the slopes represent change in the response variable for each 1 unit change in the predictor for all else held constant. When getting model estimates for slopes, the “constant” values are the mean of the variable. When using ggeffects::ggpredict(), these values are printed below the prediction table (you can double check this by calculating the mean yourself!).\n\n\n\n\n\nTest results\nExample text:\nWe found that light and temperature significantly predicted plant growth, but not pH (Table 3). The overall model accounted for 87% of the variance in plant growth. For each 1 °C increase in temperature at constant light and pH, we expect 0.20 \\(\\pm\\) 0.01 increase in plant growth (Figure 4A). For each 1 watt/m2 increase in light at constant temperature and pH, we expect a 0.35 \\(\\pm\\) 0.06 increase in plant growth (Figure 4B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing which parameters to highlight\n\n\n\n\n\nWith multiple linear regression and generalized linear models, you’re usually working with pretty complex model structure. It’d be impossible (and not that interesting, necessarily) to discuss all the predictors. You can choose which one(s) you want to highlight in your visualizations and text based on what you think is most interesting/biologically relevant."
