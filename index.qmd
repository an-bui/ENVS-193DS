# Course description

Environmental scientists use data to understand the world around them. In this class, we'll learn about the tools used in environmental science and beyond to work with, analyze, and communicate about data. 

By the end of the quarter, students will be able to:  
1. Describe basic concepts of probability and statistics  
2. Identify appropriate statistical analyses to test hypotheses    
3. Conduct statistical analyses and visualize data using the R programming language  
4. Implement best practices for reproducible analysis and collaborative work  
5. Interpret and contextualize statistical results in general concepts from environmental studies
