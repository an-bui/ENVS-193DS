## What is a `README`?

A README is a file that gives a broad overview of what is in a directory or repository. If you're using GitHub, the README shows up on the repository page and is a markdown file (has the suffix `.md`). A `README` in a data repository (which you've seen on your midterm) is usually a plain text file (`.txt`).

## Why have a `README`?

You might know how your code and data are organized, but no one else does. By writing an informative `README`, people can read about the repository and then explore it to find what they're looking for. You can also write a `README` for yourself to keep things organized (i.e. understand where you've put things so that you can find them again).  

It's an extra little step that future you and anyone else working with your code/data will use to understand how your files are organized and where they come from.

## What does a `README` look like on GitHub?

You can look at [this repository](https://github.com/an-bui/README-repo) to see where the `README` shows up in a repository. It is one of the first things anyone will see.

You can format your `README` using headers and subheaders to make it easier to navigate. The button with three lines in the top right of the `README` will display a table of contents.

## What should go in a `README`?

For this class, any `README` should have at least:  

### General information

This is where a general description of the repo would go. This could include (but is not limited to):  

- names of people working in the repo  
- where the data came from  
- broad research questions and analyses to address those questions  

### Data and file information

This is where a description of the data and files could go. For example, you could describe:  

- the data file format, when you accessed the data, etc.  
- the different code files and what they contain  

### Rendered output (specifically for this class, but nice to have in other `README` files too)

For 193DS assignments, you should put a link to the rendered file here so that it is easy to access.
