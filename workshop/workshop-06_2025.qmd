## Note

There is _no formal instruction_ this week. Instead, make sure you have set up your computer to use Git and GitHub.  

**We will not be stopping for installation issues next week (Week 7).**  

## Opportunities to get help

In addition to drop-in hours, this week's workshop periods are for you to get help with installation and verify that you've set everything up correctly.  

Come to workshop to get help from An/Grace/Thuy-Tien.
